    <h3>about</h3>
    <p>Decided to chart my own course toward becoming an iOS developer, driven by my passion for the craft. To bridge the gap in my formal education, I actively sought additional certifications and immersed myself in learning through WWDC sessions, books, and blogs. This hands-on approach strengthened my technical skills and instilled the discipline to work independently and solve problems proactively. I've successfully developed and shipped applications on the Apple App Store, gaining end-to-end experience in software creation. Watching my apps go live and be used by people has been immensely rewarding, fueling my drive for excellence in iOS engineering.</p>
